# Easy Descriptive Statistics

We often want to report basic descriptive statistics on quantitative variables within our study.

Here is a simple line of code to make generating the statistics easy.

```r

t(sapply( dat[ , lapply(dat,class) == "numeric" ], summary ))

```

If you want to paste into excel so that you can make the table pretty, try this:

```r
options( scipen=8 )

desc.stats <- t(sapply( dat[ , lapply(dat,class) == "numeric" ], summary ))

write.table( desc.stats, "clipboard", sep="\t" )

```
