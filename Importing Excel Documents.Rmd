#Importing Data From Excel

##Copy & Pasting
####You can copy paste columns of data into R from excel! This can save time if you don't want to worry about working directory or file paths.

* ### Step 1
###### Select rows of data in excel and ctrl+c them.

* ### Step 2
###### Assign a variable for where you want to paste the data, using the scan() function.
```
x <- scan()
```

* ### Step 3
###### Ctrl+v to paste your data into R's console (the input area where you type commands).
###### Hit enter to "end" the scan() function.

#### NOTES ABOUT SCAN() #
##### -> Scan only works for numbers! 
###### Copy pasting this:

###### Will return this: 
Error in scan(file, what, nmax, sep, dec, quote, skip, nlines, na.strings,  : scan() expected 'a real', got 'test'

------

#Importing from .xlsx
####This is for when you have an excel file (.xlsx) which is too big to copy paste or you're too lazy to save it as a .csv or other file type.

* ### Step 1
###### Make sure your working directory is set!
```
getwd()
setwd("./Data")
```

* ### Step 2
###### Install and call the package xlsx which you can use to import excel files.
```
install.packages("xlsx")
library(xlsx)
```


* ### Step 3
###### Read in your excel file using this one easy command.
```
dat <- read.xlsx(""./Data/RoryData.xlsx", sheetName="Sheet1")
```

### Notes About Read  .xlsx #
#####  Make sure you include your sheet name or it won't work. By default in excel, the first sheet is "Sheet1" as used in the example above.
